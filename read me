Slide 1: Introduction

“Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today, I’m going to present our Student Management System, a web-based application designed to help educational institutions manage student data efficiently.”

Slide 2: Technologies Used

“Our system is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework that handles the backend and routing. The frontend uses HTML with Jinja2 templating to render dynamic content.

For data visualization, we use Matplotlib to generate charts showing student grades, and FPDF to create downloadable PDF reports that include these charts. Student data is stored in a JSON file for simplicity and ease of use.”

Slide 3: Methodology

“We followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern in designing the app:

The Model is the JSON file where student data is saved.

The View is the set of HTML templates showing dashboards and forms.

The Controller consists of Flask routes managing user requests and application logic.

We used an agile development approach, incrementally adding features, testing, and improving the system based on feedback.”

Slide 4: Process Implementation

“Here’s how the system works:

When users open the app, they log in either as a Student or Admin.

Students are directed to a personalized dashboard displaying their attendance, grades, and a bar chart visualization of their performance.

Admins access a dashboard where they can add, edit, or delete student records, and also generate comprehensive PDF reports with grade charts for all students.

The system manages sessions securely to restrict access based on roles.

Users can log out safely after completing their tasks.”

Slide 5: Flowchart Explanation

“This flowchart visually represents the process:

Starting from the app launch,

Depending on login type, users navigate to their respective dashboards,

Admins have additional management features,

Both roles have the ability to log out,

And the system ensures smooth transitions and role-based access throughout.”

Slide 6: Conclusion

“In conclusion, our Student Management System offers a simple, effective solution for managing student records, visualizing performance, and generating reports — all accessible through a user-friendly web interface.

Thank you for your attention. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have.
